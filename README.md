# Race Performance Analytics: Data-Driven Insights on Marathon Runners

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes race performance data from marathon events to uncover insights into participant demographics, performance trends, and geographic distributions. By leveraging SQL, Python, and Google Looker Studio, we processed and visualized data to generate actionable insights.

## **Dataset**
- **Raw Data:** Contains race performance metrics such as participant names, times, locations, and gender.
- **Cleaned Data:** Processed dataset with structured fields for analysis.
- **Visualization Reports:** Interactive dashboard in Google Looker Studio.

## **Technologies Used**
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** Data extraction and transformation.
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn):** Data cleaning and visualization.
- **Google Looker Studio:** Interactive dashboards and insights visualization.
- **GitHub:** Version control and project sharing.

## **Key Insights**
1. **Participant Demographics:** Distribution of runners based on age, gender, and location.
2. **Performance Analysis:** Variations in completion times based on different demographic factors.
3. **Geospatial Insights:** Mapping race participation trends across different states.

## **How to Use This Project**
1. **SQL Analysis:** Run `SQLQueryAnalysis.sql` in SSMS to analyze race data.
2. **Python Analysis:** Open `script.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis.
3. **Dashboard Visualization:** Access the Looker Studio Report
